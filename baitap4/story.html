              <p><br>
                What is the one philosophy that drives SCAAL? We <br>
                believe that no matter where you go, you should <br>
                always be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a <br>
                good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. At <br>
                home, reading the morning paper. At your local <br>
                SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in <br>
                some foreign land, SCAAL will be greeting you like <br>
                an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that <br>
                transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel <br>
                alert, energetic and alive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 45px; color: #76BF4E;"><strong>Where we began</strong></span></p>
              <p><br>
                Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small <br>
                fishing village in Marstrand, Sweden. As a child, he listened to stories of his grandfather Oluf’s <br>
                adventures and expeditions. Often his grandfather <br>
                would bring back exotic coffees for the family to <br>
                enjoy. </p>
              <p>Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the <br>
                world. He worked all kinds of odd jobs. He worked in Parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He worked<br>
                in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in <br>
                a few years, Anders learned the art of selecting the <br>
                perfect coffee bean and roasting it to perfection. </p>
              <p>He returned home in 1980 to open the first SCAAL in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique <br>
                blends of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere, <br>
                SCAAL quickly became the place to gather – day or<br>
                night – not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but 670 <br>
                cities around the world. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #76BF4E; font-size: 45px;"><strong>What makes SCAAL &nbsp;the best</strong></span>
                <strong><span style="font-size: 45px; color: #76BF4E;">coffee?</span></strong><br>
                Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned <br>
                as an apprentice in the coffee fields to every buyer, <br>
                roaster, and franchise owner. SCAAL's standards for <br>
                coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB – strictly hard bean or strictly high grown – coffee <br>
                beans. To ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee <br>
                bean from heat, light, air and moisture. </p>
              <p>All these efforts are made so that we may offer you <br>
                a perfect cup of coffee.</p>
              <p>There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure that <br>
                SCAAL is your best choice. The quality begins at <br>
                harvest. SCAAL relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive process that involves making several <br>
                passes among the trees for those cherries that are <br>
                perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which <br>
                stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. <br>
                Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 <br>
                feet above sea level for optimum flavor. Within <br>
                hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are <br>
                roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified <br>
                Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh <br>
                taste and rich aroma.</p></td>
